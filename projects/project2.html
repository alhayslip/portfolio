    <h3>Rationale for Design Decisions</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Rationale 1: I created a new binary column, “After Neighborhood Policing,” to determine if an incident was filed when Neighborhood Policing was established in New York City. I set the date range from June 2015 to December 2019. This decision renders a score of -1; it is deceptive, as the dates I chose for this column were selected based on independent research I did on when Neighborhood Policing was implemented in New York.</li>
      <li>Rationale 2: I filtered for a data frame that captures data on complaints in 2015. This decision allocates a score of -2; it is deceptive mainly because I cherry-picked a year’s worth of data to determine if there is a difference in the number of complaints by month in 2015.</li>
      <li>Rationale 3: I created a list titled month_order, which contained all the months in ascending order. Additionally, I specified that the order argument was set to 'month_order', which resulted in the months being displayed in ascending order on the x-axis. This is a score of 2, as it is an earnest decision that helps the reader understand the graph better.</li>
      <li>Rationale 4: I used the hue argument “After Neighborhood Policing” in sns.countplot to compare differences across ethnic groups. This generates a score of 2, this is effective visual encoding that helps the user understand the data better in barplot.</li>
      <li>Rationale 5: I used plt.legend to clearly label True/False distinctions for “After Neighborhood Policing.”. This generates a score of 2, this is effective visual encoding that helps the user understand the data better in barplot.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Rationale for Design Designs</h3>

I set the date range from June 2015 to December 2019. This decision renders a score of -1; it is deceptive, as the dates I chose for this column were selected based on independent research I did on when Neighborhood Policing was implemented in New York.</li>
      <li>Rationale 2: I created a binary column “force” indicating whether a complaint was for excessive force. This is a neutral decision (score of 0), as I was interested in creating a new column to showcase whether a complaint was filed due to an excessive use of force.</li>
      <li>Rationale 3: I created a new dataframe `force` containing only records where “force” is True. This is a neutral decision (score of 0), as I was interested in focused on all records where the complaint was filed due to an excessive use of force.</li>
      <li>Rationale 4: I filtered for complaints between 2011 and 2019 to compare before (Jan 2011–May 2015) and after (June 2015–Dec 2019) neighborhood policing. This decision is deceptive (score of -2), as I cherry picked nine years worth of records, evenly split by whether it occurred before and after neighborhood policing was implemented.</li>
      <li>Rationale 5: I used the hue argument “After Neighborhood Policing” in sns.countplot to compare differences across ethnic groups. This generates a score of 2, this is effective visual encoding that helps the user understand the data better in barplot.</li>
      <li>Rationale 6: I used plt.legend to clearly label True/False distinctions for “After Neighborhood Policing.”. This generates a score of 2, this is effective visual encoding that helps the user understand the data better in barplot.</li>

  <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    All the decisions that I made in the design process were contingent on performing the following data cleaning steps. My design process involved understanding the type of question I wanted to visualize, identifying the segments of data required to capture the data I wanted to see, and deciding on the visualization I wanted to use to showcase the trends in the data effectively. I made decisions such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I replaced the numerical content in the <strong>Month When Complaint Was Received</strong> and <strong>Month When Complaint Was Closed</strong> columns with the name of the month (e.g., 2 was replaced with February).</li>
    <li>I changed the data type for the <strong>Precinct</strong> column from <code>object</code> to <code>int64</code>.</li>
    <li>I dropped null and duplicate records from the original dataframe which contained all of the allegations.</li>
    <li>I combined the <strong>Month When Complaint Was Received</strong> and <strong>Year When Complaint Was Received</strong> columns into one column, <strong>Allegation Month and Year</strong>.</li>
    <li>I converted the <strong>Allegation Month and Year</strong> column into a datetime format using <code>pd.to_datetime()</code>.</li>
    <li>I wrote an <code>np.where</code> statement to define a binary column <strong>After Neighborhood Policing</strong>, which defined whether the record occurred before or after neighborhood policing was implemented in June 2015.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The most challenging part of this analysis was filtering the original dataframe to ensure that the column for force was created. The intention of doing this was to initiate an <code>np.where</code> statement to create a boolean value based on whether the column “Specific Category of Complaint” contained the phrase “force.” Then, I created a new dataframe titled <strong>force</strong>, which filtered for all records where the column was set to true. Additionally, I used the <code>isin</code> argument to filter the force dataframe further to segment all records between 2011 and 2019. I chose those years to account for the four years before and after neighborhood policing was implemented.
  </p>

  <p>
    My conclusion is that a stronger argument can be made that neighborhood policing was not effective in reducing the number of complaints filed. The visualization used in the proposition highlighted that the number of complaints increased after neighborhood policing was implemented. The bar plot for 2015 showed that the number of complaints increased in the months following implementation. While there is evidence that neighborhood policing reduced complaints for excessive force by Black and Hispanic citizens, the data does not indicate a decrease in total complaints overall.
  </p>

  <p>
    I define ethical analysis and visualization as understanding how to appropriately clean, filter, and visualize data in a way that effectively demonstrates trends and patterns without a hidden agenda. The bounds distinguishing acceptable from misleading design choices are often blurred, but I use the criteria of understanding what type of decision I’m making and its implications to determine ethical versus misleading visualization choices.
