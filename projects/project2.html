  <h1>Project 2 – Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?</h1>
  <p>Alex Hayslip – alhayslip@ucsd.edu</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Proposition: Despite the introduction of Neighborhood Policing in 2015, the number of complaints filed did not decrease.</h2>
    <img src="https://alhayslip.github.io/portfolio/images/lineplot.png" 
         alt="Line graph of complaints filed in New York City from June 2015 to December 2019, after neighborhood policing was implemented."

  <section>
    <h2>For the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="https://alhayslip.github.io/portfolio/images/2015_barplot.png"
         alt="Barplot showing complaints filed in 2015 before and after neighborhood policing was applied in NYC."
         width="600">
    <ul>
      <li>Rationale 1: I created the new binary column "After Neighborhood Policing" to determine if an incident was filed after the program’s implementation in NYC.</li>
      <li>Rationale 2: I filtered for a dataframe containing data on complaints in 2015 to visualize only that year.</li>
      <li>Rationale 3: I created a "month_order" list to order the months in ascending order on the x-axis.</li>
      <li>Rationale 4: I used the hue argument “After Neighborhood Policing” in sns.countplot to separate data before and after the program.</li>
      <li>Rationale 5: I added plt.legend to distinguish True/False values of “After Neighborhood Policing.”</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Against the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="https://alhayslip.github.io/portfolio/images/force.png"
         alt="Barplot showing complaints filed for use of excessive force by ethnicity before and after neighborhood policing was implemented."
         width="600">
    <ul>
      <li>Rationale 1: I created a binary column “force” indicating whether a complaint was for excessive force.</li>
      <li>Rationale 2: I created a new dataframe `force` containing only records where “force” is True.</li>
      <li>Rationale 3: I filtered for complaints between 2011 and 2019 to compare before (Jan 2011–May 2015) and after (June 2015–Dec 2019) neighborhood policing.</li>
      <li>Rationale 4: I used the hue argument “After Neighborhood Policing” in sns.countplot to compare differences across ethnic groups.</li>
      <li>Rationale 5: I used plt.legend to clearly label True/False distinctions for “After Neighborhood Policing.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>My design process began with cleaning and transforming the data to answer specific questions visually.</li>
      <li>The most challenging step was filtering the data correctly for complaints about excessive force.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that force-related complaints among Black and Hispanic citizens decreased after implementation, though overall complaints didn’t drop.</li>
      <li>The 2015 barplot was more persuasive, showing an increase in total complaints after implementation.</li>
      <li>Ethical visualization requires filtering and presenting data truthfully without manipulating reader perception.</li>
    </ul>
