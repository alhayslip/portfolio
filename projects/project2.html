    <ul>
      <li>Rationale 1: I filtered for a dataframe that contained data on complaints in 2015. This was used to capture data for complaints that were filed in 2015, as I was interested in visualizing these records.</li>
      <li>Rationale 2: I created a variable titled "month_order", which is a list of all months contained in ascending order. This helps order each month that occurred in 2015 on the x axis to help the user follow along.</li>
      <li>Rationale 3: I assigned the hue argument of "After Neighborhood Policing" for the sns.countplot. This decision was made to distinguish whether the month on the x axis occurred before or after the implementation of Neighborhood Policing in New York City. This decision was made to help the user understand the difference in complaints filed in 2015 before and after neighborhood policing was applied.</li>
